"""Compare two lockfiles: which packages got worse on a target, and which new packages have gaps.

    wheelgap diff old/uv.lock uv.lock -p 3.13 -t linux-aarch64,musl-aarch64
    python -m wheelgap.diff old/uv.lock uv.lock -p 3.13 -t linux-aarch64 --json

Both sides are checked with `check_lockfile()` and packages are matched by canonical name. Exit 1 if
anything got worse (a new package with a gap counts), 0 otherwise, and 2 on bad input.

How statuses rank, per target:

- `wheel`, `bundled` and `n/a` are all fine and rank the same; `source` is worse than them, and `missing`
  is worse than `source`.
- `unknown` (the package couldn't be checked) isn't on that scale, because it says nothing about what pip
  would do. So a change is never called "not worse" on a guess: anything → `unknown` is worse, and
  `unknown` → `source` or `missing` is worse too. Only `unknown` → `wheel`, `bundled` or `n/a` is not.
  `unknown` on both sides counts as worse if the version changed; at the same version it's unchanged, and a
  note on stderr names those packages.
- A package installed from somewhere wheelgap doesn't check (git, a path, a URL, an editable install or a
  private index) is "skipped" on that target and treated like `unknown`: anything → skipped is worse, and
  skipped → `source` or `missing` is too. Skipped on both sides is unchanged. A new skipped package counts as
  a new gap, except a uv `virtual` project, which installs nothing. This is decided per target, so a uv.lock
  fork or marker split that is checked on one target and skipped on another is compared target by target.
- A requirements-file path with no name (`./pkg`, or `-e ./pkg` without `#egg=`) is matched by its path, not
  a package name: `ranged==1.5` → `./ranged` shows `./ranged` as a new gap (still exit 1), not as `ranged`.
- A package listed more than once (a uv.lock fork) takes its worst status on each target, with `unknown`
  beating `missing`, and ignoring `n/a` unless every entry is `n/a`.
